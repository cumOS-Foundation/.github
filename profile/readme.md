### September 2023: cumOS 2.0 Initial announcement
hello, cumOS enthusiasts.
I am writing this letter to you all as a courtesy. cumOS in it's current state is very janky and barely functioning. this is because I made the bold and courageous decision to use an experimental technology (Rust) to develop cumOS. Rust made it very easy to get cumOS up and running, but unfortunately give me little control or help in making cumOS truly shine on most modern computers. due to my choice to use Rust, cumOS is only compatible with PS/2 keyboards and 800x600 VGA 16 color monitors, for example. cumOS's goal was to build the next big computing experience for the next generation. in an effort to continue and execute this goal, I am officially announcing a complete rewrite of cumOS using custom, documented technologies. this will take some time, however. I expect the complete transiton of cumOS from Rust to C to take roughly a month. I deeply apologize for the delay, but it must be done. with this transition, cumOS will be able to:
- work on 64-bit computers (previously only worked on 16 bit computers)
- have a proper commandline and GUI
- have multitasking
- use a custom boot process
- use more than 16 colors
- work with USB devices
just to name a few! i, again, deeply apologize for the delay, but this is needed to make cumOS truly shine. if there's one thing i know about the cumOS community, I know that we can persevere and wait. this is the future. this is cumOS 2.0.
### October 2023: cumOS 2.0 progress update & beta announcement
Good morning cumOS enthusiasts,
I am happy to report that the rewrite of cumOS has been going swimmingly, and a beta version will be available Saturday. thanks to the improved architecture, cumOS 2.0 brings many beloved features to the cumOS experience:
- USB support (keyboards only)
- Commandline interpreter (allows you to run commands, like cd, ls, mkdir, etc.)
- SDK! Write your own apps for cumOS using the C programming language (Rust coming soon)
-More than 16 colors
- Ability to do math with numbers higher than 32,168
cumOS 2.0 will be the next big thing in personal computing, right after cumOS 1.0 took the personal cumputing world by storm earlier this year. this is the future. this is cumOS 2.0: the voice of a generation
